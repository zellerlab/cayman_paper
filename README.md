# Repository for the code belonging to the paper () about CAZymes and the gut microbiome

This repository contains all the code required to reproduce the figures from [Ducarmon & Karcher et al](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.01.0), describing the Cayman tool and large-scale analysis of CAZymes in human gut microbes.

Except for 2 large files, required data files can be found in the data folder. Please download the remaining 2 files from [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/10473258) and move them to the data folder before running the scripts.

Before one can reproduce the figures, you first need to run the Data_Preparation_Cleaning.Rmd script.
